Spectrogram classiÔ¨Åcation using dissimilarity space

If you have memory problem we suggest to reduce the value of "batchsize"

This code works only with gray level images, instead "https://github.com/LorisNanni/Image-Classification-Using-Dissimilarity-Spaces-built-with-Siamese-Networks"  works also with color images

This code is deprecated, please download the last version of our Siamese based method:
